# Chronic_Kidney_Disease-Data-Set
Implement classification and predict the appropriate attribute by selecting any  Chronic_Kidney_Disease Data Set.
## The domain selected.
The domain of the dataset is medical or health informatics. It is a collection of data related to patients with Chronic Kidney Disease, including demographic information, laboratory test results, and medical history

 ## Aim of the project.
 The goal is to use data analysis to identify patterns and relationships in the data and then use this information to predict which patients have the disease and what attributes may be contributing to their condition.  Chronic Kidney Disease is a common condition, affecting millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management can help prevent the progression of the disease and improve outcomes for patients.

## Motivation behind the project.
 By using machine learning techniques like clustering or classification, it is possible to automate the process of identifying patients with Chronic Kidney Disease, making the diagnosis more efficient and accurate. This can have significant implications for patient care and treatment, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life for patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.
## Details on the techniques used.
* Decision Tree
* Linear regression
* SVM
* Naive Bayes
* Artificial neural network


#### Naive bayes proved to have highest accuracy and good confusion matrix 
#### Therefore it was choosen to create a model with data that has less dimension 
#### The selection of attributes was from analysising the correlation matrix
